                description: 'SIL laser engraving machine is versatile & finds application in signage, indoor & outdoor advertisement, art & craft, gift, shoes, toys, garments, model cutting, papers & packaging, wood & MDF cutting industry, interior, decorators and many more. SIL built laser engraver which is engineered & manufactured in india. SIL laser systems can be configured with two types of lasers, Glass Tube & Metal Tube. Glass Tube: The glass tube lasers are of very high quality, compact and come with warranty period of 6 months. Metal Tube: All metal tube lasers are RF excited with option of water cooling. Metal tube covers a warranty of 24 months. SIL series incorporates DSP based stand alone control system for offline work with 32 mb file space & easy to use printer driver software. The machine can print directly from AutoCAD, CorelDRAW, Photoshop etc. Printing real pictures, deep engraving, gradient engravings are the main features. High speed belt drive plotting unit with precise micro stepping drives. Rotary, Image Auto Tracing Camera, Two Laser Head, Four Laser Head, Honey comb are optionals Working table: 1300 X 2500 mm/ 1200 X 1200 mm/ 1300 X 900 mm/ 600 X 900 mm/ 600 X 400 mm.',
